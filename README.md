# TimingAttack

<h3>Context</h3>
<p>Burp Suite is used by a huge percentage of security professionals, especially penetration testers. It is often used as an HTTP interception tool. Burp Suite's utility is greatly improved by a variety of plugins, many of which are free to use.</p>
<p>TimingAttack is also a plugin open source to help pentesters for guessing if a username is valid or not by how long time the system takes to respond to an fail authentication. And then, comparing that to how long the system takes to respond for a valid login. It means that if attackers can guess one valid username, then they can guess much more using the same technique.  Best part of it, it is totally automated by the attacker.</p>
